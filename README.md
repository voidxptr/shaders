# Shaders

#### tldr: This is a list of all the shader that I like to show of on the Internet. All the code is under MIT license and all renders under CC-BY.
###### tldrtldr: When you use any of this code or the renders credit me.

Btw please ignore the countless of spelling and grammattical errors, I am not a nativ english speaker.

## What even is this?
This is a repository that containes all the shader that I make to post online or want to make freely available for everyone.
This is a project made in the Godot Engine (4.1.1), the License to this engine can be found at : https://godotengine.org/license/.
The Shaders are not optimized, I have still *no* Idea what im doing, but I will do my BEST to make the code readable and maybe even documented.

## Can I use this?
*(I don't know why you would ever want to)*

All the code is available under the MIT license (LICENSE.txt) and all the renders under CC-BY (IMGLICENSE.txt).
